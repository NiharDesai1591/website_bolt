 <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
 A hands-on, techno-managerial leader, I am driven by a deep-seated passion for bridging the gap between technology and on-the-ground execution, with a focus on practical application and utility of technology to drive tangible business or social gains. My career is a testament to this philosophy, spanning a breadth of experiences from the shop floor of traditional industries to the cutting edge of machine learning.It's a journey defined by a relentless bias for action and an unwavering commitment to execution.

 My professional foundation was forged in the unglamorous but invaluable world of manufacturing, a passion that began in my childhood, observing my father's tire factory. It was there that I first understood the magic of machines and the complex symphony of business. This passion for building and a hands-on approach extended to my college life, where I channeled it into the FormulaSAE competition. As the leader of a team building racing cars, this project was a masterclass in techno-commercial skills, team building, and the sheer grit required to turn a complex vision into a tangible machine. Sports have also been a big part of my life, instilling a competitive spirit and discipline. This adventurous spirit also extends to my hobbies, from solo skydiving to scuba diving. My willingness to embrace new challenges, push boundaries, and remain hands-on has been a constant thread from my early projects to my professional life.

 After college, I began my career at Larsen & Toubro, where I learned the art of leading a team with humility and a hands-on approach, building trust with the very people who bring ideas to life. This experience was the perfect prelude to my next, most transformative chapter: co-founding Gaia Batteries. As a 23-year-old, this venture was a humbling, four-year crucible that stripped away all ego and taught me the true meaning of ownership. It was a journey of relentless failure and persistence, where I learned everything from managing a workforce and cash flow to navigating sales and complex government compliances. What makes this experience unique is that I am an insider to the world of MSMEs, having lived and breathed the challenges they face. I am not just familiar with, but deeply understand, the realities of these businesses, a perspective that informs all my work today. While it remains the lowest professional point in my life, I know that this experience is the bedrock of who I am today, and I draw upon its hard-won lessons in every role since.

 My journey took a pivotal turn during my MBA at the Indian School of Business (ISB). After years in an archaic industry, I had a stark realization: the future was digital, and I needed to pivot. This led me to Ola Electric, where I found myself at the forefront of a transportation revolution. My role evolved from program managing the factory's physical construction—leveraging my manufacturing background—to designing digital systems for logistics and customer journeys. It was here that I truly connected the dots between hardware and software, seamlessly translating operational needs into robust software engineering solutions and gaining invaluable exposure to the world of product management.

 I landed at ARTPARK without a direct background in machine learning, a testament to the belief that my hands-on ownership and ability to learn were the key assets. My initial responsibility was to run the Vaani project, a groundbreaking initiative to create India's largest multi-modal AI dataset. This project is the seed to the future of AI in Indic languages, a flywheel of innovation aimed at empowering low-resource languages that might otherwise be left behind. I leveraged my operational rigor, stakeholder management, strategic thinking, and product thinking to manage this massive undertaking, all while learning about the fundamentals of ML and its dependence on high-quality data. It has been a humbling and exhilarating experience to build a project with the potential for massive social impact.

 <p className="text-lg mb-4">
 Over time, my role at ARTPARK evolved from managing a large-scale data operation to a leadership position focused on creating the high-level vision and strategy for our work with LLMs in public health. While my focus shifted to securing new partnerships and defining long-term goals, my hands-on background ensures that every decision I make is grounded in the operational realities of what it takes to get things done on the ground. I now bridge the gap between high-level strategy and practical implementation, a unique advantage that allows me to lead with both foresight and a deep understanding of the execution process.

 <p className="text-lg">
 Today, my strength lies in my unique ability to understand a problem from multiple dimensions—from the physical realities of manufacturing to the complex logic of software and the ethical considerations of AI. I don't just see the big picture; I understand the smallest detail required for flawless execution. I am a leader who thrives on building, scaling, and translating innovative technologies into tangible business and social gains, driven by the same passion that started on a factory floor.
